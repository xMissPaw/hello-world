# hello-world
My first repository
Hi there!

My name is Diana and I'm an 20 years old student passionate about many things and eager to 
discover which are my strong and weak points in order to develop myself and find my future
job domain. I love video games, Japan stuff and volunteering in the greatest youth organisation 
named AIESEC.
Well that's about me!

Thankies!
